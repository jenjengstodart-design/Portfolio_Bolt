      "question": "Tell me about yourself",
      "answer": "I'm an experienced business strategist and innovation management consultant with over 20 years of experience in agencies, consultancies, and in-house enterprise companies. I've worked with ambitious change leaders and founders across a wide range of sectors -FMCG, media, telecoms, retail, and government, including Mars Foods, Mars Snacking, Mars Pet Nutrition, PepsiCo, Channel 4, The Economist, TalkTalk, Waitrose, John Lewis, National Physical Lab, Innovate UK, and Kingston University.\n\nI blend a human-centred and structured approach (enhanced by AI tools) to unlock growth by defining, designing and launching products, services and ventures. My work ranges from facilitating strategy workshops to align teams, delivering design sprints to expedite processes, to developing business models and experiments to validate ideas and product-market fit, and innovation processes to solve complex problems and deliver transformation."

    {
      "question": "What's your biggest weakness?",
      "answer": "I care deeply about my work, my team, and how we perform together. This means I can burn out easily if I don't watch myself and my team. I've learned to be more mindful about pace and sustainability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are you leaving your current role?",
      "answer": "I was offered redundancy and took it. It's given me space to be intentional about what's next."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?",
      "answer": "In a senior role in a design and innovation establishment, running my own AI-native agency, lecturing at a university teaching innovation, or running my own supper club celebrating Mediterranean and Italian simple dishes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell me about a time you failed",
      "answer": "I didn't recognise that I'd been insensitive to a consultant who needed better explanation and support from me. I learned to slow down and check understanding more carefully, especially with junior team members."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are you looking for in your next role?",
      "answer": "I'm looking for roles in innovation and innovation management -specifically setting up innovation and venture functions, helping C-suite leaders build innovative companies, and driving organisational transformation and redesign."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are you NOT looking for?",
      "answer": "I'm not interested in marketing and advertising roles, positions requiring heavy travel, or environments with excessive reporting layers and approval processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your management style?",
      "answer": "I've managed several direct reports and led large teams across multiple workstreams. I set clear goals and establish open communication. I'm directive with junior consultants who need guidance, but I tend toward a mentoring and coaching style overall. I set high expectations and expect my team to contribute ideas and thinking, though I make the final decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your work style?",
      "answer": "Collaborative and action-based. I'm also a thinker and I expect all my team members to help me with the thinking and give me ideas, but I make the final decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you NOT like?",
      "answer": "Innovation theatre -I can't stand performative innovation that doesn't lead to real change or impact."
    }
