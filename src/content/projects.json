          "privateChallenge": "The associate attrition rate, especially on the shopfloor, was disrupting workflows and straining manufacturing resources. The company was treating the symptom, not the cause. No one had asked what would make new associates want to stay -or recognized that office employees and shop-floor workers faced completely different pain points.",
          "approach": "We mapped the existing onboarding journeys for different Associate types, then designed and tested onboarding experience prototypes -from physical welcome boxes to digital alerts and communities to accelerate and deepen connections of new hires to their teams. We piloted an end-to-end onboarding journey in one region of the snacking business, measured uptake, and iterated based on what worked.",

          "approach": "Conducted research across 10 stores through interviews and collaboration workshops. The goal was to identify the critical moments in the customer journey where the regeneration created either friction or opportunity.

          "approach": "We started by clarifying the problem before jumping to solutions. Working with leadership, we developed an initial high-level organisation design and a visual structural blueprint showing how the institution could evolve. We then mapped out a Change Management programme and equipped internal teams with the tools, insights, and confidence to implement the new operating model themselves.",

          "approach": "We ran an 8-week diagnostic sprint across the product organisation, interviewing across hierarchy levels and product groups to understand where things were actually breaking down.

          "privateChallenge": "The team believed that getting the right people in a room would naturally produce the right AI applications. But a long list of AI use cases isn't a strategy. Without grounding in actual business pain points and strategic priorities, they'd end up with shiny ideas that went nowhere.",
          "approach": "We reframed the entire exercise. Instead of starting with 'what can AI do?', we started with 'what's actually causing pain?' We mapped the supply chain team's pain points and their customers' friction, then identified where AI could specifically eliminate those problems. We compiled the output into a narrative for the Petcare C-suite, connecting each potential investment to strategic outcomes -pitched 'Mission 98.5' (98.5% Customer Service Level by 2027) as the unifying North Star.",

          "privateChallenge": "With AI capabilities expanding rapidly, Miro wanted to demonstrate how AI could enhance productivity and quality of work for their user base. But the conversation around AI was noisy and abstract. They needed a concrete, practical showcase -proof that AI and design thinking together could deliver more than either alone.",
          "approach": "We partnered to design and deliver a program showing AI in action from two angles: the consultant's perspective and the designer's perspective. This wasn't theoretical -we demonstrated real workflows, real tools, real outputs. We coordinated closely with the platform team to develop the event content and delivered it as both a live session and a webinar for broader reach.",

But AI in education risked being either too abstract or too superficial -students needed to experience AI as a collaborative partner in real consulting scenarios.",
          "approach": "We designed and ran a hackathon simulating real-world consulting at speed. Student teams tackled a complex merger scenario -integrating a fast, agile, innovation-driven company with a structured, hierarchical, compliance-focused one. AI tools (mainly Gemini Gems) were woven throughout: AI-assisted diagnosis to map cultural tensions, AI-supported ideation to generate interventions, and AI-powered prototyping to articulate leadership models.",

          "privateChallenge": "The digital team was advanced in innovation methodology but was unable to come together for multi-disciplinary collaboration as everyone's time was occupied by day-to-day demands. Good ideas stalled before they started. They needed a process that worked within real constraints.",

The compressed format forced focus: real-time problem solving, no sprawling workshops. We facilitated the sprints live, keeping momentum high and decisions moving.",
