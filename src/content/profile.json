  "elevatorPitch": "I work with ambitious leaders — founders, C-suite executives, and change-makers — to turn big ideas into real, measurable growth. Whether that means building your innovation capability from scratch, redesigning how your organisation works, or using AI to unlock new value, I bring structure, energy, and 20 years of hard-won experience across FMCG, media, healthcare, retail, and government.",
  "careerNarrative": "My approach blends strategic rigour with creative problem-solving — always starting with the people involved, whether that's your customers, your teams, or your leadership.\n\nIn practice, this means facilitating strategy workshops that get leadership teams aligned, running design sprints that compress months of work into days, and building innovation processes that actually stick long after I've left.\n\nI've always used the best tools available. Right now, that means AI — not as a gimmick, but as a genuine way to work faster, think bigger, and deliver more for my clients.",
