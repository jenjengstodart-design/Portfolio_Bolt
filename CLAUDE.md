# Writing Rules for jenjeng.com

Claude reads this file automatically at the start of every session. These rules apply to ALL content written for Jen's portfolio site.

---

## Punctuation

- No em dashes (—). Use ` - ` (space-hyphen-space) instead
- If you need a longer pause, use ` -- ` (space-double-hyphen-space)
- No Oxford comma overuse
- Use contractions: I'm, you're, it's, don't, won't -- sounds more human

---

## Sentence style

- Vary sentence length. Mix short punchy ones with longer ones
- Don't start multiple sentences in a row with "I"
- Avoid triplets that feel too balanced ("X, Y, and Z" patterns are very AI-typical)
- Not every bullet needs a tidy conclusion -- mid-thought is fine sometimes
- Direct and confident. No hedging language

---

## Words and phrases to NEVER use

These are AI giveaways:

- Delve / Delving
- Unlock / Unlocking
- Leverage / Leveraging
- Elevate / Elevating
- Seamless / Seamlessly
- Transformative / Transformation (use "change" or be specific)
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "In today's world..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Navigate" (in a metaphorical sense)
- "Landscape" (as in "the AI landscape")
- "Robust"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Game-changer"
- "Holistic"
- "Synergy"

---

## Jen's voice

- Direct and confident -- she says what she means
- Occasionally informal: "Actually", "Honestly", "Here's the thing"
- Short sentences when making a point
- She doesn't oversell herself or use superlatives unnecessarily
- When writing for her chatbot/AI: honest, warm, direct -- never corporate
